**User Request:**

create a website for my digital marketing agency, **Prodesk IT**. I need your help to build it significantly because I want to rely on AI assistance for this project.

Can you generate the complete code for a responsive, modern single-page website? 

**My Requirements:**
*   **Tech Stack:** Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks like React or Bootstrap).
*   **Design:** I want it to look premium and professional. Please use a nice font like 'Outfit' and a blue color scheme.
*   **Features:**
    *   A Sticky Navbar with a Logo and links.
    *   **Dark Mode**: A toggle button to switch between light and dark themes.
    *   **Mobile Menu**: A hamburger menu for phone screens.
    *   **Hero Section**: Big text saying 'We Build Digital Experiences' with a CTA button.
    *   **Services**: A grid showing things like SEO and Web Development.
    *   **Footer**: Simple copyright and social icons.

I want the code to be clean and easy to understand. Please provide the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.
